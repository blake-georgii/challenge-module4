# Module 4 Challenge
## Description
I made a JS quiz with 5 questions and a timer using mostly Jquery. The timer will subtract 15 seconds if a question is answered wrong and the timer is used as the highscore. The user can input their name and it will be saved alongside their highscore and displayed on the highscore.html page.
